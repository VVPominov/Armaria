Hi all!
This is a pet project about bookcrossing between local home libraries and other people who love to read.
If you have books that you would like to trade with someone, sign up and offer them to trade from your home library.
The project is in progress now.

Used technologies: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sqlite.

Best wishes.
